At this stage, you need to add the ability to read and write original and cipher data to files. The program must parse two additional arguments -in and -out to specify the full name of a file to read data and to write the result. Arguments -mode, -key, and -data should still work as before.

Your program should read data from -data or from a file written in the -in argument. That's why you can't have both -data and -in arguments simultaneously, only one of them.

If there is no -mode, the program should work in enc mode.
If there is no -key, the program should consider that key = 0.
If there is no -data, and there is no -in the program should assume that the data is an empty string.
If there is no -out argument, the program must print data to the standard output.
If there are both -data and -in arguments, your program should prefer -data over -in.
If there is a non-standard situation (an input file does not exist or an argument doesnâ€™t have a value), the program should not fail. Instead, it must display a clear message about the problem and stop successfully. The message should contain the word "Error" in any case.
