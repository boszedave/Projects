# Simple Banking App

This app is using SQLite for many functions:
- make a new database file with the specified name, or update the existing one
- make a new bankcard with valid numbers (using Luhn algorithm and sumcheck) and store it in the database
- login/logout to/from account
- deposit and transfer money
- delete account (delete from database)
