# Spotify Music Advisor

The program uses Spotify Web API to make these 4 functions work:
 - featured - list of Spotify featured playlists with their links
 - new - list of new albums with artists and links on Spotify;
 - categories - list of all available categories on Spotify
 - playlists C_NAME, where C_NAME - name of category. List contains playlists of this category and their links on Spotify;

I also used Michael Thelin's wrapper (https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-java) to make my work easier.
